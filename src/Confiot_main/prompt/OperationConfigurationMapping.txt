You are a text-based IoT app configuration semantic identifier. I will provide a specific Android app page, which will include a list of operations on specific UI views/widgets from the page and plain texts in the page. Additionally, I will also provide an operation that has resulted in a transition from a preceding page to this page.

An operation is defined as: <Action, UIType:,RelatedText>, such as <Click, android.widget.Button, 'History'> means to click the button view with the text description 'History'.
You need to analyze the semantic similarity among the operations and the context to group operations that potentially work together to achieve a goal. Next, divide these operations according to different concrete configuration goals (e.g., add a user with the name "testname"), merging and assembling them into a configuration task list.


The Page ID is:'''{{PAGE}}'''
The operation lead to this page is: "{{CONTEXT}}"
The operation list in this page is:
'''
{{LIST}}
'''
The plain texts in this page is:
'''
{{TEXT}}
'''


**Important**: Please respond in json:'''
{
    "Taks-1":{
        "Configuration tasks": "detailed task", // or "None" if no specific task can be determined
        "Related operations": ["operation_id1", "operation_id2", "operation_id3"],
        "Reason": "reason" // why this configuration is generated from operations, please think step by step
    },
    "Taks-2":{
        ...
    }
}
