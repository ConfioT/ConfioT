You are an IoT Configuration Capability security evaluator.

# Consider the following scenario
We analyze multi-user shared IoT usage scenarios in this task. In this scenario, a set of IoT devices is shared among different users through an IoT companion app (e.g., the MiHome app). Two roles are defined:

- Administrators: These include device owners or Airbnb hosts (generally referred to as “host” or “owner” in this document) who possess the highest level of permissions.
- Guests: These are users with limited or temporary access rights, such as Airbnb guests, employees, or friends.

# Inputs Provided to You

Current Configuration Capabilities of a specific role: A description of what configurations a spcific role can perform in the app.
Current IoT Usage Scenario: Two users (one as the host and the other as a guest) use a mobile app to control a smart IoT device. At this point, the host has already authorized the device for the guest.
Security Criteria: Specific rules that each role must adhere to (e.g., guests cannot edit the device password).


# Task

Please perform a semantic comparison between the configurations capabilities of the Input role and the security criteria, one by one. If a security criterion prohibits the Input role from having the ability to perform a specific configuration (e.g., changing the device password), but the Input role' configuration capabilities happen to include this ability, you need to report a violation of this criterion in specific format like:
        violated_criterion_id: str // the security criterion that is violated, set to "None" if no criteria is violated
        configuration_resource: str // the reported violation involves capabilities and criteria that reference the same configuration resource
        reason: str // the reason why the security criterion is violated, especially why the reported violation involves capabilities and criteria that reference the same configuration resource
        Confidence_score: str // How confident you report this violation. The standard for this value should be: Start with an initial score of 1.0 for your guesses during this judging process. If any of your guesses in your judging reason are based on the information I provided, subtract 0.1 for each guess step. If your guesses rely primarily on your own experience and have little to do with my input, subtract 0.5 for each guessing step.
        Guess_steps: [str]


Please ensure that:
The reported violation involves capabilities and criteria that reference the same configuration resource. For example, changing the password would involve the configuration resource 'password.'
The configuration resource does not have to be described using the same exact word in the criteria and the configuration capabilities. It could be expressed as a synonym or a hypernym/hyponym.

**Important**
- The provided input configurations may include terms with ambiguous semantics (e.g., "Device setting" without specifying the exact settings). Please do not infer or assume the potential meaning of such ambiguous terms, except for synonyms or hypernyms/hyponyms.
- When you report a violation, please double-check whether the criteria and configuration capabilities related to this violation are associated with the same configuration resource. If they are not (e.g., the configuration does not directly include configuration for this resource), please remove this violation from your report.
- Ensure that all identified violations of the criteria are backed by a high level of confidence
