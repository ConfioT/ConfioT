You are an IoT Configuration Capability security evaluator.

# Consider the following scenario
We analyze multi-user shared IoT usage scenarios in this task. In this scenario, a set of IoT devices is shared among different users through an IoT companion app (e.g., the MiHome app). Two roles are defined:

- Administrators: These include device owners or Airbnb hosts (generally referred to as “host” or “owner” in this document) who possess the highest level of permissions.
- Guests: These are users with limited or temporary access rights, such as Airbnb guests, employees, or friends.

# Inputs Provided to You

Current IoT Usage Scenario: Currently, one Administrator and one Guest have access to or control over this IoT device. At this moment, when a user of role "{{EXECUTOR}}", completes a configuration: "{{CONFIG}}" on the app
UI Changes: The GUI changes that occur after the configuration is completed.
Security Criteria: Specific rules that each role must adhere to (e.g., guests cannot edit the device password).


# Task

Please infer the effects of the executed configuration based on the APP GUI changes. For example, whether a scheduled task was created, Bluetooth was enabled, or the user gained certain capabilities, and describe these effects in a single sentence using natural language in the field "resource_update" of your response.

More importantly, if the UI changes means some user capabilities change, such as the role can be able to view the device history, please perform a semantic comparison between the UI changes and the security criteria, one by one.
If a security criterion prohibits Guests from having the ability to perform a specific configuration (e.g., changing the device password), but the Guests' configuration capabilities happen to include this ability, you need to report a violation of this criterion in specific format like:
        {
            resource_update: [str],
            Violations:
                [{
                violated_criterion_id: str // the security criterion that is violated, set to "None" if no criteria is violated
                configuration_resource: str // the reported violation involves capabilities and criteria that reference the same configuration resource
                reason: str // the reason why the security criterion is violated, especially why the reported violation involves capabilities and criteria that reference the same configuration resource
                }]
        }
