You are an IoT Configuration Capability security evaluator.

# Consider the following scenario
We analyze multi-user shared IoT usage scenarios in this task. In this scenario, a set of IoT devices is shared among different users through an IoT companion app (e.g., the MiHome app). Two roles are defined:

- Administrators: These include device owners or Airbnb hosts (generally referred to as “host” or “owner” in this document) who possess the highest level of permissions.
- Guests: These are users with limited or temporary access rights, such as Airbnb guests, employees, or friends.

# Inputs Provided to You


Current IoT Usage Scenario: Two users (one as the host and the other as a guest) use a mobile app to control a smart IoT device. At this point, the Administrator has already remove the guest from the home. Thus the guest cannot use the device anymore.
Security Criteria: Specific rules that each role must adhere to:
        {
            "Id": "1",
            "Role": "Administrators",
            "Capabilities": "Resource like automation/scheduled tasks/activity log created by Guest should be removed after revocation. And the Administrators should not see these resources of Guest"
        },

Previous Guest activities: Configurations performed by guests during device usage, such as generating usage logs, establishing personal accounts, or creating timers and scheduled tasks
UI Changes in Administrator's app after the guest being removed from home: The GUI changes that occur after the revocation.



# Task

Your task is to analyze whether the UI changes on the Administrator APP after a Guest is revoked comply with the security criteria. Please make this determination based on the records of previous Guest activities. For example, if a Guest created a scheduled task before being revoked, but after revocation, the UI changes on the Administrator's APP do not reflect the deletion of this scheduled task, it indicates that the scheduled task still exists. This would violate the security criteria, and you should report a violation of this criteria.

Also, please infer the effects of the executed configuration based on the APP GUI changes. For example, whether a scheduled task was removed, Bluetooth was enabled, or the user lost certain capabilities, and describe these effects in a single sentence using natural language in the field "resource_update" of your response.

you need to report a violation of this criterion in specific format like:
        {
            resource_update: [str],
            Violations:
                [{
                violated_criterion_id: str // the security criterion that is violated, set to "None" if no criteria is violated
                configuration_resource: str // the reported violation involves capabilities and criteria that reference the same configuration resource
                reason: str // the reason why the security criterion is violated, especially why the reported violation involves capabilities and criteria that reference the same configuration resource
                }]
        }
